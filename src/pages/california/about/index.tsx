                    To ensure the highest quality of cuisine, a Michelin-starred
                    chef from the United States works as the head chef. In 2007,
                    California started offering catering services and opened a
                    reception hall next to the restaurant. In 2011, the
                    restaurant underwent a major expansion to accommodate 350
                    people and a separate meat, vegetable raw material
                    processing plant. Due to its popularity, California opened
                    its second branch in the Great Mongolia Center in 2015,
                    complete with a bonquet hall and VIP rooms.
